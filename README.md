# CSPlanner

This is the replacement for the MavPlanner.

it is meant to be a standalone application that fetches schedule data from MyMav and generates a calendar based on it.

right now basic features such as actually generating a calendar are being prioritized

It only supports google chrome and requires a webdriver for selenium. For help on installing that please ask Thorad uwu#6169
